# SpaceXPlorer microfrontend project

This project demonstrates usage of microfrontends to resolve issues in a regulated environment. It is initially created to support the presentation [Micro-frontend magic in a regulated environment](https://ndccopenhagen.com/agenda/micro-frontend-magic-in-a-regulated-environment-00z0/0w17gkfq7be) as part of NDC Copenhagen conference.

## Getting started

This project consists of two microfrontend applications and two parcels.
To run this project enter into each folder, keeping `spacexplorer-single-spa` as last and run:

```sh
yarn install && yarn serve
```

This should launch a composed application on port 3000.

## Authors

This repository and the presentation are work of [Nikola Kovacevic](https://kovacevic.dev) and [James Strachan](https://mestrak.com/).
